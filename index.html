        love notes on smartphones,
        <br />
        giggling at shared memes together in the back of a van
        <br />
        driving through the dark night
        <br />
        Unaware of where you're going
        <br />
        Or whom is driving
        <br />
        <br />
        Relationship status updated
        <br />
        Now everyone knows
        <br />
        What's tinder, but a roundabout way
        <br />
        for computers to breed humans?
        <br />
        <br />
        Building trust merely on a smile
        <br />
        Enough to meet a stranger in a park
        <br />
        Or bumping into them while playing Pokemon Go
        <br />
        Don't stalk your ex on snapchat
        <br />
        It tracks their movement for you everywhere
        <br />
        <br />
        See, they're having fun without you
        <br />
        Now it's time to look at all these couples posing,
        <br />
        Their perfect lives shown for all to envy
        <br />
        Hiding their misery impeccably
        <br />
        They plan to divorce in 2020
        <br />
        <br />
        Polycule? Triad? Mono? Metamour?
        <br />
        Someone at the orgy kept using these words
        <br />
        At first unsure, but now more informed.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a fluster and hurry it can be hard to decide
        <br />
        whether to quickly ask for someone's:
        <br />
        Phone Number or
        <br />
        Facebook or
        <br />
        Email or
        <br />
        Instagram or
        <br />
        Snapchat or
        <br />
        Twitter or
        <br />
        Myspace or
        <br />
        Linkedin(please don't do this) or
        <br />
        Pinterest or
        <br />
        Tumblr or
        <br />
        Reddit or
        <br />
        Some obscure app/website that is their only method of contact hitherto unheard of,
        <br />
        guess it's time to start an account on whatever a
        "Mastodon" is...
        <br />
        <br />
        There's this person, a newly met stranger at a random party,
        <br />
        yet when it's time to exchange numbers...
        <br />
        Somehow you already had each others numbers saved.
        <br />
        <br />
        Remember late that one night on OkCupid?
        <br />
        Getting a message from someone
        <br />
        Whom OkCupid's matchmaking algorithms claimed
        <br />
        99% compatibility
        <br />
        Someone with a shared taste in music
        <br />
        and movies or something
        <br />
        the conversation went on,
        <br />
        and ended with sharing each others numbers
        <br />
        <br />
        They had an odd username,
        <br />
        and their pictures looked nothing like them, standing here now
        <br />
        Staring back with a raised eyebrow
        <br />
        saved numbers never used
        <br />
        Hearts unbroken or abused
        <br />
        Memories together not yet made
        <br />
        Of Joy, of Anger, of grief, of pain
        <br />
        Of just dancing like idiots in the rain
        <br />
        A meeting that could be said to have been caused,
        <br />
        First by a matchmaking algorithm,
        <br />
        Then by fate
        <br />
        <br />
        In hindsight, it seems quite clear
        <br />
        That matchmaking algorithm needed some serious debugging.
